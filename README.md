## Anime face detection
* refer to blog for more info: [seuphor's blog](http://seuphor.github.io/personalsite/deep_learning)

## Notes:
* This repo is only for reference purpose
* Trained weights and test image is not uploaded due to amount of data size
* pickle folder is used for storing processed training data
* Test_source is used for storing raw data
* saver is used for storing weights


## Acknowledgements

The implementation is based on the projects: 
* A Convolutional Neural Network Cascade for Face Detection
